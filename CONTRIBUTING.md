# Contributing to Toggle Tab Completion

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is greatly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs to suggesting new features or improving documentation.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. A great bug report includes:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- The expected behavior and what happened instead.
- Your VS Code version and operating system.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, feel free to open an issue to start a discussion. This allows us to align on the idea before you put significant work into it.

## Development Setup

To get the extension running on your local machine for development and testing:

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stefanoaldegheri/toggle-tab-completion.git
    cd toggle-tab-completion
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Open the project in VS Code**:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
5.  **Start the debugger**:
    Press `F5` in VS Code. This will compile the TypeScript code and launch a new **Extension Development Host** window with your extension running. You can make changes, and they will be reflected in the host window after a quick reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`).

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any new code follows the existing style and that all tests pass.
2.  Make sure your pull request has a clear title and a description of the changes.
3.  Link to any relevant issues that your pull request resolves.
4.  Update the `README.md` or other documentation if your changes affect how the extension is used.

Thank you again for your contribution!
